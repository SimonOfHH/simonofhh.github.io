Hello ya'll! 

This is my first ever blog post. Whenever I have some spare time (which is, sadly, not so often) I'm working on stuff from what I think makes my (work) life easier. Up until now I mostly did it for myself or shared it internally in our company network. 

But now I think it might be a good idea to be more public. So, whenever there is something worth sharing I'll try to write up some infos about it and share it with you. 

Cheers, Simon
