Well, since you're on this page it might be a good idea to write a little something about me (I guess).

In 2007 I started my professional training/apprenticeship with .NET development (preferably C#). I worked at an end-customer and mostly developed internally-used tools and started a little bit later with customization of the brand new Microsoft Business Solutions-Navision 4 system (which shortly after that became Microsoft Dynamics NAV).

A couple of years later (I was just 22) I felt the need to move to a bigger city and found a place in Hamburg, Germany (after all the 2nd biggest city here). Since then I'm on the service-side of Dynamics NAV/Dynamics 365 and help customers with everything related to our beloved ERP system.

I never really limited myself to "just" development or to a specific language/framework. I like getting around new tools, languages, etc. and use most of my free time in this area.

### More Information

Things I'm familiar with (on a level that makes me confident enough to list them public ðŸ˜‰)
* Microsoft Dynamics NAV / Dynamics 365 Business Central
  * Development (almost anything, probably except for "Inventory Profile Offsetting" ðŸ˜…)
  * Consulting (pretty good understanding in all SCM-related areas (Purchase, Sales, Warehouse), general understanding of other modules)
* .NET / C#
* PowerShell
* SQL Server
* Azure (ARM / CLI)
* Azure DevOps
* ... probably more that I can't think of right now.
